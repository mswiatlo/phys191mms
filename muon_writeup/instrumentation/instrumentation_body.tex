\section{Instrumentation}

In order to detect muon and electron events, signals from scintillators are correlated and matched against an expected pattern. The next section will discuss how these are used to generate lifetimes; here, we focus on describing the apparatus and problems associated with it.

\subsection{Scintillators}

The scintillator consists of polystyrene ($\mathrm{C}_{8}\mathrm{H}_{9}$) doped with a phosphorous material, p-terphenyl. When ionizing radiation passes through the material a light pulse is emitted. The light flash is detected by the photomultiplier tubes placed at the ends of the
