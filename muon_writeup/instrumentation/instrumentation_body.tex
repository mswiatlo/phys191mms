\section{Instrumentation}
\label{instrumentation}

In order to detect muon and electron events, signals from scintillators are correlated and matched against an expected pattern. The next section (\ref{procedure}) will discuss how these are used to generate lifetimes; here, we focus on describing the apparatus and problems associated with it.

\subsection{Scintillators}
\label{scintillators}

The experimental setup consists of three scintillators stacked vertically, presenting a $5251.3 \pm $ cm$^2$ area to a downward traveling muon. The three scintillators and corresponding photomultiplier tubes will be referred to as `top', `middle', and `bottom' throughout according to their physical placement.  Each plastic scintillator consists of polystyrene ($\mathrm{C}_{8}\mathrm{H}_{9}$, with density $1.08 \pm .09 {\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$) doped with a phosphorous material, p-terphenyl. When ionizing radiation passes through the material a light pulse is emitted. The light flash is detected by the photomultiplier tubes placed at the ends of the scintillator. The photomultiplier uses a high voltage (on the order of $1000$ V) to convert the light pulses into a cascade of electrons more or less linearly (i.e., the amplitude of the electrical signal from the photomultiplier is linear with the light output, and thus with the energy of the ionizing radiation).

The signals from the photomultipliers are then fed into a bank of discriminators, each of which outputs a NIM voltage pulse of tunable width after detecting a voltage pulse above a given threshold. These signals are input into the logic which identifies types of events (Section \ref{logic}). In the muon lifetime measurements, only the discriminator outputs are used as signals. For the muon mass measurement, the discriminated signals are still used for event detection, but the raw output of the photomultiplier is viewed directly so as to determine the true pulse amplitude, and thus the energy of the detected particle. 

\subsubsection{Photomultiplier False Flashes}
\label{photomultiplierfalseflashes}

The photomultiplier tubes used in the experiment have the property of producing false signals, which occur with some regularity directly after a real signal is detected. The number of these signals, as detailed in the autocorrelator section of Appendix~\ref{muontimeerroranalysis}, follows a more or less exponential decay (that is, there are exponentially fewer false pulses at longer times than shorter times). However, the decay lifetime is on the order of magnitude of the muon lifetime, so false signals may be mistaken for events and affect the lifetime measurement. For instance, a false signal mistaken for a decay product will artificially shorten the measured lifetime, and the true signal will not be detected.  This will skew the overall data in the direction of shorter mean lifetimes.

Different techniques, described below (\ref{efficiencyoptimization}) and in the \emph{Procedure} section (\ref{muonlifetimemeasurement}), were used to lower the effect of these false signals; however, they remain a significant pollutant of data at the low end of the timescale, and must be dealt with statistically (see Appendix~\ref{muontimeerroranalysis}).

\subsubsection{Efficiency Optimization}
\label{efficiencyoptimization}

Many different factors come into consideration for choosing the detector settings. The priority is maximizing the efficiency of the detectors so as to maximize the count of detected muons; this can be achieved by increasing PMT voltages to increase the magnitude of output signals and decreasing threshold levels to allow more signals past the discriminator. The other main concern is noise (particularly false flashes), which increases at higher voltages and lower thresholds; this concern keeps voltages lower and thresholds higher. An optimization procedure determines the optimal settings to maximize efficiency.

The optimization technique relies on the very high number of muons that go straight through all three detectors. As most muons are very high energy when they reach the surface of the earth, nearly the entire flux from the atmosphere passes through all the detectors without stopping\footnote{The measured values are $3150$ counts per minutes passing through all three scintillators, and $3$ counts per minute stopping in the middle scintillator. Thus $99.9\%$ of muons pass through without stopping}. In addition, the flux of muons per solid angle from a direction at angle $\theta$ to the vertical is proportional to cos$^3(\theta)$ \cite{frisch}, so the chance of a muon coming in at a steep enough angle to graze the top detector and not the bottom ones is very small. Thus, nearly $100\%$ of events that are detected by two of the three scintillators should be detected by the third one as well. Employing this fact, and taking the ratio of the number of events detected by all three detectors as compared to the number detected by just two of the detectors, we can get an approximation of the efficiency of the excluded detector, as any event detected by just the two should have been detected by all three. The ratio should be effectively 1 for a perfectly efficient detector, as losses from solid angles and muons which stop in the detectors are incredibly small as compared to the total muon flux. We chose the most efficient detector to be in the middle, as most of the signals require at least one middle input.

Optimal voltage values are chosen by plotting efficiency against voltage; this produces a function that increases dramatically at low voltages but soon plateaus. A value in the middle of this plateau is chosen to guarantee the high rate of efficiency, but not so high as to increase noise. Optimal values for discriminator threshold levels were chosen in a similar fashion; a plot of threshold versus efficiency showed a plateau as discriminator levels are lowered. Once again a middle value on the plateau is chosen, in an attempt to balance guaranteeing high efficiency with noise concerns.

Initial data runs were taken with very high efficiency: $99\%$ efficiency for the middle detector, $83\%$ for the top, and $90\%$ for the bottom. Voltages for the photomultiplier tubes were set at $1160$ V, $1190$ V, and $1190$ V respectively. All the thresholds were set to $70$ mV. 

After the discovery of noise problems detailed above and in Appendix~\ref{muontimeerroranalysis}, the efficiency of the detectors was lowered considerably, to $91\%$, $70\%$, and $78\%$. Voltages were changed to $1140$ V, $1160$ V, and $1130$ V, with thresholds raised uniformly to $100$ mV.

\subsection{Logic}
\label{logic}

In order to register muon events, signals are fed out of the discriminator into a series of logic banks. For example, to register a muon passing all the way through (used in optimizations and muon mass measurements), the equation $T \wedge M \wedge B$ is used: that is, all three signals are anded together. Any time that all three detectors flash simultaneously, it is clear that a muon has passed through all of them. It is unlikely that two separate muon events will be anded; about $50$ muons pass through the scintillators in one second, so we expect real muon events every $.02$ s. Pulses out of the discriminator, on the other hand, are set to $100$ ns for the top and bottom detectors and $50$ ns for the middle (set differently in order to guarantee overlap); thus, since pulses are five orders of magnitude quicker than the rate of incoming muons, we expect negligible overlap errors. Furthermore, time of flight values for muons and electrons traveling between the scintillators are negligible; see Appendix~\ref{timeofflight} for details.

The muon lifetime measurement requires a signal that indicates a muon has stopped in the middle scintillator; we call this event START, as this would start the lifetime count. The signal is simply given by $\mathrm{START} = T \wedge M \wedge \bar{B}$; that is, a signal is detected on the top and middle detectors but not the bottom. This either means that the muon has stopped in the middle detector, or gone past the bottom detector at an angle; because of the close distances between the scintillators (on the order of cm), this latter case is unlikely, and we can interpret the event as a stopped muon.

Similarly, the muon lifetime measurement also requires a stop signal. The stop would occur after the decay has happened; that is, an electron has been detected. After the muon decays, the electron can move off in any direction (since the muon was at rest, and the neutrinos take care of momentum conservation), but generally speaking we can expect the electron to be detected not just at the middle detector, but either the top or bottom one as well (since most electrons will have some vertical component in their momentum, and given the large area of the scintillators, a small amount of vertical momentum will result in the electron striking the detector). Thus, a simple STOP event would be defined as: $\mathrm{STOP} = (T \wedge M \wedge \bar{B}) \vee (\bar{T} \wedge M \wedge B)$; that is, a stop event is either a bottom going or top going electron.

However, these signals allow for START and STOP events to happen simultaneously: note that STOP is actually defined by a START event or'ed with a different event. Moreover, consider the scenario in which a muon stops in the middle detector, but the resulting electron actually comes out the side; instead of admitting that there was no STOP detected, the next START event would be recorded as a STOP. Thus, we should redefine STOP to occur only after a valid START, within some acceptable timeframe. The logic diagram in Figure~\ref{figure:logic} illustrates the solution: STOP as it is currently defined is anded with a delayed gate signal (that is, a delayed signal set constantly high, set to expire after a given amount of time) that is triggered by a START event. The delay to the start of the gate is set to 100 ns, twice as long as the 50 ns pulses outputted by the logic units, guaranteeing that simultaneous events will not trigger a measurement; the gate length is set to $20 \mu s$, 10 times the expected lifetime: waiting any longer is likely waiting for an electron which went out in an undetected fashion.

\subsection{Autocorrelator}
\label{autocorrelator}
In order to better study the effects of the photomultiplier false flashes, we used a Langley Ford Instruments Model 1096 Correlator to track the autocorrelation of the signal coming from each photomultiplier. The machine monitors an input line for a signal, and records the correlation values of the signal with itself, offset by times from $0$ to $80$ bin widths. We set it to record bins of $0.1~\mu$s, up to a total of $8 \mu$s after the starting signal. Because the rate of muons coming into a scintillator is significantly smaller than this timescale, any autocorrelated signals can be assumed to be false flashes (indeed, if there were extra muons coming in during this window, we would expect an even distribution over all times, but we did not see this).

\subsection{Measurements}
\label{measurements}
To take measurements, a LabView program records data from a $100$ MHz digital oscilloscope over a GPIB connection. For the lifetime experiment, the oscilloscope is set to trigger on a stop event, and the program measures the difference in time between the beginnings of the start and stop pulses, on channel 1 and 2 of the oscilloscope respectively. The range of lifetime values measurable by the oscilloscope was $0$ to $18 \mu$s. For the mass experiment, the scope is set to trigger on channel 2 (a logic pulse indicating the required condition) and to monitor the height of the muon or electron pulses on channel 1 (the actual output from the middle photomultiplier).
