\section{Background}

The weak decay of the muon is the clearest of all weak interaction
phenomena in both its experimental and theoretical aspects. Thus, the muon
decay is an effective means of studying the weak force, and
specifically finding the weak coupling constant $g_w$. Negatively
charged muons decay weakly into an electron, muon neutrino, and
electron antineutrino (Figure):

\begin{equation}\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \nu_{mu}\overline{\nu_e}\end{equation}

with a corresponding antimatter process:

\begin{equation}\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \overline{\nu_{mu}}{\nu_e}\end{equation}
