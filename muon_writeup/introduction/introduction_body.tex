\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The muon, a fundamental particle produced in the upper atmosphere as a
secondary product of cosmic ray collisions, was originally discovered
in 1936 \cite{}. It decays via the weak interaction with a mean decay
lifetime of $2.2 \mu s$, longer than every known particle other than
the neutron \cite{}. With muons comprising $80$\% of cosmic ray flux at
sea level, the muon is a good candidate for the study of the weak
force \cite{}.

Our experiment consists of two main components: the muon lifetime
measurement and the muon mass measurement. In section 2,
\emph{Background}, we introduce the theoretical basis for these
measurement as well as that of muon creation and decay. We describe
the experimental setup which consists of a system of three
scintillators and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in \emph{Setup}. Using
this system, the cosmic ray muons passing through the scintillators
and their decay products can be detected along with their enegy
(\emph{Procedure}). The muon lifetime and mass results are presented in
\emph{Results} and \emph{Discussion} with the relevant statistical
analysis of data, and compared to previous experimentally established
values. Finally, we use the muon mass and lifetime values to calculate
the weak force coupling constant, $g_w$.
