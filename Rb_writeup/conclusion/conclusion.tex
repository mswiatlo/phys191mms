\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this experiment, we observe several properties of rubidium atoms in an optical pumping system. We observe Rabi oscillations by pumping atoms to a preferential state $m_{F}$ and coupling them with a radiofrequency signal to a lower $m_{F}$ level. The g-factors for both isotopes of rubidium are calculated to be $g_{F}=0.30\pm0.03$ for $^{85}$Rb and $g_{F}=0.46\pm0.05$ for $^{87}$Rb, within error of the respective expected values $g_{F}=0.33$ and $g_{F}=0.50$. The ratio of g-factors is calculated to be $g_{87}/g_{85}=1.5\pm0.2$, even in stronger agreement with the expected value of $g_{87}/g_{85}=1.5$. The optical pumping time in our experimental conditions was calculated to be $\tau = 5.9\pm 1.5$ ms and the spin relaxation time was found as $T_{1}=1.2 \pm 0.2$ ms, both in reasonable agreement with
