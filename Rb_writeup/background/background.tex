\subsection{Optical Pumping}

Optical pumping is the process in which the interaction of light with
atoms produces a population of energy levels that is distinct from the
thermal equilibrium Boltzmann distribution \cite{bernheim}.

In this experiment, we consider a Rubidium atom and focus on the $D_1$
transition between the $^2P_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$ excited states.
