\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Observing Optical Pumping and RF Interference}

With the external magnetic field applied, laser light is used to optically pump Rb atoms into a preferential spin state.  To observe this pumping, we measure the fluorescence of pumped Rb atoms using an oscilloscope.  This sample data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:raw_pumping}.

RF interference is used to disrupt the optically pumped steady state by coupling the pumped $m_F$ state to the next (lower) $m_F$ state.  This coupling creates a transient phenomenon which is signified by the decrease in signal from the pumped level to some new steady state.  In order to closely analyze the transient portion due RF interference, a chopped RF signal is used.

The depumping caused by the $m_F$ coupling combined with optical pumping gives rise to Rabi oscillations in the transient portion between the fully state and the new equilibrium.  This phenomenon is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rabi}.  The oscillations signify periodic fluctuations in spin state populations due to the $m_F$ coupling.    

\subsection{Measuring Linewidth and Optical Pumping Resonance}

Using a lock-in amplifier, we measure the amplitude of Rabi oscillations as a function of applied RF frequency.  We use a \emph{LabVIEW} program in order to select and step through a range of RF frequencies in order to produce a Lorentzian resonance.  This data was taken for both $^{85}$Rb ($F=2$ to $F=2$, $F=3$ to $F=3$ transitions) and $^{87}$Rb ($F=1$ to $F=1$, $F=2$ to $F=2$ transitions).   This data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rawcurve}.

This data was fit to lorentzian distributions.  These fits were then used to calculate the center, or resonant,  frequencies.  The resonant $m_F$ coupling frequencies for $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb are $161.7$ kHz and $243.0$ kHz respectively.  

Further measurements are taken using the $^{85}$Rb $F=3$ to $F=3$ transition to determine the effect of RF amplitude and laser light intensity on the linewidth of the resonance. By independently varying either of these variables, several resonances are measured.  Using a \emph{Mathematica} program, the linewidths of these resonances are calculated and plotted with respect to both RF amplitude and laser light intensity.  This data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:linewidths}.

The variable being held constant was held constant in a regime in which it would not have a confounding effect on the linewidth (\emph{i.e.} while varying light intensity, RF amplitude was minimized and \emph{vice versa}). 
The data are fit to $\alpha\sqrt{1+\beta x^{2}}$
