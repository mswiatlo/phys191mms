We present measurements and observations of several properties of optically pumped rubidium atoms. A vapor of mixed $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb is brought to a preferential $m_{F}$ state through absorption of circularly polarized light. The g-factors of the two isotopes are measured by coupling the system to radiofrequency magnetic field and finding the strongest coupling frequency. The optical pumping time $\tau$ and spin relaxation time $T_{1}$ are measured by optically pumping the system and then letting it evolve without light for variable periods of time. The spin decoherence time $T_{2}$ and related power-broadening effects are measured as functions of the intensity of light and radiofrequency amplitude. Finally, we find the spin-exchange rate between the two isotopes by pumping one and driving Rabi oscillations on the other. The g-factors are calculated to be $g_{f}=0.30\pm0.03$ for $^{85}$Rb and $g_{f}=0.46\pm0.05$ for $^{87}$Rb, in very good agreement with predicted values $g_{f}=0.33$ and $g_{f}=0.50$ respectively. Times for optical pumping and spin relaxation are reasonable, and $T_{2}$ displays the expected power-broadening behavior. The calculated spin-exchange rates are in good agreement with the understanding that most of the spin decoherence rate is due to spin-exchange collisions.
