\section{Background}\label{background}

The He$^4$ atom is a very simple and symmetrical system among the
elements, with a filled innermost electron shell and no overall
electric or magnetic moment or angular momentum \cite{atkins}. Due to
the symmetric nature of helium atom, the interaction between them is
very weak, and He$^4$ liquifies at an extremely low temperature of
$4.21$ K. However, an even more interesting transition occurs at
$2.17$ K, at which point liquid helium acquires several unique
properties. Below this temperature, termed the $\lambda$ point because
of the shape of the heat capacity, The most remarkable of these are an extremely high
thermal conductivity, negligible viscocity, a The investigation of
these properties will the the focus of this paper. Although the i


We observe the very high thermal conductivity of helium II by noting
the sessation of bubbling below the lambda point. We
