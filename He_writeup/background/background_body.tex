\section{Background}\label{background}

The $^4$He atom is one of the very simple and symmetrical systems
among the elements, with a filled innermost electron shell and no
overall electric or magnetic moment or angular momentum to the atom
\cite{atkins}. Due to the symmetric nature of helium atoms, the
interaction between them is very weak, and $^4$He liquifies at an
extremely low temperature of $4.21$ K. However, a more interesting
transition occurs at $2.17$ K, at which point liquid helium takes on
several unique properties. Below this temperature, termed the
$\lambda$ point, $^4$He\footnote{Although the isotope $^3$He is also
  capable of producing these effects, the transition temperature is
  much lower at $3\times 10^{-3}$ K and is unreachable with the
  cryogenic technology available to us. Thus, in the remainder of the
  paper, the isotope $^4$He is implied unless stated otherwise.}
acquires extremely high thermal conductivity, negligible viscocity,
and the ability to propagate temperature waves(second sound); in
addition, there is a $\lambda$-shaped discontinuity at the transition
in the heat capacity of liquid helium, which is how the $\lambda$
point acquires its name. To distinguish the two phases of liquid
helium, the liquid is referred to as helium I above the lambda point
and helium II below the lambda point (BLAHHH). The investigation of
the properties of helium II mentioned above will be the focus of this
paper.

\subsection{The Two-Fluid Model}

A key model explaining the unusual properties of He II was proposed by
Landau in 1941 as the two-fluid model \cite{landau}. In this theory,
the liquid below the $\lambda$-point can be viewed as being composed
of two noninteracting fluids: a superfluid component with density
$\rho_s$ and a normal component with density $\rho_n$, such that the
total density $\rho$ is given as the sum of the two components:
\begin{equation}
\rho = \rho_s + \rho_n
\end{equation}

and the total current density of He II is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{j} = \rho_s\mathbf{v_s} + \rho_n\mathbf{v_n}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{v_s}$ and $\mathbf{v_n}$ are the velocities of the
superfluid and normal fluid, respectively \cite{tilley}. Then, the
behavior of the fluid can be understood in terms of the different
characteristics of the two components: while the normal fluid acts
according to the regular laws of fluid mechanics and satisfies the
Navier-Stokes equation, the superfluid carries zero entropy and flows
with zero viscocity. Furthermore, it is important to note that the two
components are non-interacting, that is, there is no transfer of
momentum between the two fluids, and most importantly that they are
not physically distinct and cannot be separated \cite{tilley}.

With the incorporation of theories of Bose-Einstein condensates into
Landau's theory, further understanding of the fluid is possible. The
superfluid can be viewed as an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate
system, occupying a single macroscopic quantum state, whereas the
normal fluid consists of the excitations (photons and rotons) of the
superfluid. As temperature decreases from $2.17$ to $0$ K, the
fraction of superfluid increases, from $0$ at the $\lambda$-point to
unity at absolute zero, and the excitations decrease to zero \figure{BLAHHH}.

\subsection{Heat Transfer and Second Sound}

\subsubsection{Thermal Conductivity}
The thermal conductivity of He II is very high, and tends to infinity
for small heat currents \cite{tilley}, making the fluid intolerant
to temperature gradients. This property explains the visually
noticeable transition from He I to He II with decreasing temperature:
while in He I, there is a lot of bubbling, as the temperature drops
past the $\lambda$-point, the bubbling ceases immediately, since a
temperature gradient large enough cannot be established in order for a
bubble to form \cite{tilley}.


\subsubsection{Frictionless Flow}
Another property of helium II is that the superfluid component is able
to flow without energy dissipation. Since superfluid flows with zero
friction, it is possible to construct a barrier which permits
superfluid, but not normal fluid, to flow - such as tightly pressed
crushed glass WHAT IS IT I DONT KNOW. Then, if a temperature gradient
is established across such a barrier, the only possible flow is
superfluid flow, and the superfluid will flow toward the higher
temperatures in order to reduce the gradient. As a qualitative
demonstation of this property, our experiment seeks to observe the
'fountain' effect, where



Interestingly, the superfluid fraction cannot directly transfer heat,
but is able to balance temperature gradients not through conduction
and convection but through an exchange of the relative concentrations
of the two componenets $\rho_n$ and $\rho_s$. As seen in FIGURE
TWOFLUID, at lower temperatures the fraction of superfluid increases
and the fraction of normal fluid decreases, so it is possible to think
of the superfluid component as 'cold' and the normal component as
'hot' \cite{atkins}. Thus, superfluid flows up temperature gradients
while normal fluid flows toward lower temperatures.

This method of heat propagation in He II leads directly to the
definition of a different kind of wave possible in the fluid: second
sound. The term is defined in contrast to sound, known as first sound,
waves, which is a pressure wave and travels via a variation of
density. Second sound is a temperature wave, and propagates instead
via a movement of superfluid and normal fluid past each other, with
constant total density at each point. 

The relationship between velocity of second sound, $u_2$, and the
relative fractions of the fluids was derived analytically by Landau
and is given by

\begin{equation}
u_2^2 = \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_n}\frac{T S^2}{C}
\end{equation}

where $S$ and $C$ are the entropy and heat capacity per gram of the
liquid and can be measured experimentally \cite{atkins}. Thus the
speed of second sound decreases with increasing temperature, and goes
to zero at the $\lambda$-point, where the superfluid fraction
dissapears.
