\section{Error in Second Sound Calculation}\label{errorinsecondsoundcalculation}

Error in this part of the experiment was due to statistical error in the measurement of the displacement of the balometer from the heater and in the measurement of the duration between the triggering and the observation of a heat pulse.  Because the fitting produced fit parameters with relatively small errors, the error from the fit is small compared to the actual measurements.  Because second sound speed is given by $u_{2}=\Delta x/ \Delta t$, the relative error in $u_{2}$ is given by the the relative errors in these measurements summed in quadrature.  This results in a relative error of $4.2\%$.  But, because there are $N=6$ points in each data set, we must divide this error by $\sqrt{6-2}$ giving a final relative error of $2.1\%$ for each value of $u_{s}$.  Due to our procedure described in Section \ref{secondsoundanalysis}, there is no systematic error in our calculation of $u_{s}$.
