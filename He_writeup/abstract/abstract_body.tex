We present our measurements and observations of several different properties of superfluid $^{4}$He. Liquid helium is lowered to superfluid temperatures, below the lambda-point $T_{\lambda}$, by means of a pumping system. Observations of the transition to the helium II state and the `fountain effect' are conducted through a glass viewport. The velocity of second sound, \emph{i.e.} entropy waves, is measured as a function of temperature by measuring the travel time of a pulse of heat. The specific heat of helium around $T_{\lambda}$ is found by measuring the temperature response to a known pulse of heat. Both measurements are in very good agreement with established measurements. The lambda-point itself is calculated as $T_{\lambda} = 2.178\pm0.081$, in very good agreement with the established value. Finally, using the second sound velocity and specific heat values, the ratio of superfluid helium to normal helium as a function of temperature is calculated.
