  We present our measurements and observations of several different
  properties of superfluid $^{4}$He. Liquid helium is lowered to
  superfluid temperatures, below the $\lambda$-point $T_{\lambda}$, by
  lowering the vapor pressure with a pumping system. Observations of
  the transition to the helium II state and the `fountain effect' are
  conducted through a glass viewport. The velocity of second sound,
  \emph{i.e.} temperature waves, is measured as a function of
  temperature by recording the travel time of heat pulses. The
  specific heat of helium around $T_{\lambda}$ is found by measuring
  the temperature response to a fixed heat pulse. Both measurements
  are in very good agreement with established measurements
  \cite{atkins}. The $\lambda$-point itself is calculated to be
  $T_{\lambda} = 2.178\pm0.081$ K, in excellent agreement with the
  established value \cite{atkins}. Finally, using the second sound
  velocity and specific heat values, the fractions of superfluid and
  normal fluid helium are calculated as a function of temperature, in
  strong agreement with prior experiments\cite{andro}.
