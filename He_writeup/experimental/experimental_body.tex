\section{Experimental}\label{experimental}

Several features are common to all three experiments performed. Two separate dewars are used in the experiment; both are Precision Cryogenic Systems model PVS-337 LHe Vapo-Shield Dewars. Aluminized Mylar superinsulation provides isolation to the external environment. The preparatory procedure for all experiments is to precool the chosen dewar to 77 K using liquid nitrogen and then to fill the dewar with liquid helium. Temperature control of the liquid helium is achieved by pumping on the liquid with a vacuum pump: changing the vapor pressure also changes the temperature in a predictable manner, subject to a calibration found in (something).

\subsection{Visual Observation Experiments}

The first experiment consisted of visual observations of different phenomena in superfluid helium. One helium dewar was available with a glass observation port near the bottom; while this increases coupling to the environment and thereby raises the lowest achievable temperature, it is still possible to pump the helium down to superfluid temperatures.
