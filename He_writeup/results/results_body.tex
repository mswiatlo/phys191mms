\subsection{Second Sound Results}
\label{secondsoundresults}

To measure the velocity of second sound in He II, the propagation time of heat pulses in the superfluid is observed over a range of temperatures. First the displacement between the balometer and the heater (both fully submerged) is measured. Next, heat pulses sent from the heater propagate towards the balometer as second sound. The duration between the triggering of the heat pulse and the pulse's signature recorded by the balometer was observed and recorded. Multiple displacements and corresponding durations were recorded for various temperatures ranging from $1.6$ K to $2.2$ K, shown in Figure \ref{fig:secondsoundraw}. Second sound velocity goes to zero as the temperature approaches $T_{\lambda}$.

\subsection{Heat Capacity Results}\label{heatcapacityresults}

To measure heat capacity, we observe the effect of heat pulses sent to the cell on a germanium resistor which is thermally coupled to the cell. Beginning at a temperature of about $1.8$ K, $10$ ms heat pulses with a power of $98.8$ mW were sent to the cell.  These heat pulses caused the temperature of the cell to rise which consequently caused the resistance of the coupled germanium resistor to increase.  Because the current through the germanium resistor is a constant $1.00$ $\mu$A, a decrease in resistance causes a decrease in the potential difference across the resistor. The change in the potential difference due to consecutive heat pulses sent to the cell was measured while the copper cell was both filled and evacuated. Figure \ref{fig:rawdata} shows portions of this data for both scenarios.  Over the course of the experimental run, the potential difference in both cases falls in discrete sections due to the consecutive heat pulses. While the changes in potential per heat pulse are uniform in the empty cell for the entire observed temperature range, the changes in potential difference for the filled cell depend upon whether the temperature of the cell is above or below $T_{\lambda}$. This disparity is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rawdata}.

Each heat pulse is $10$ ms with a power of $98.8$ mW.  From this data we see that $T_{\lambda}$ occurs at $0.671 \pm 0.001$ V judging by the sudden change of the heat pulse's signature.}}

Knowing the amount of energy deposited in the cell along with the change in temperature, we can calculate heat capacity of the evacuated copper cell and the copper cell filled with helium. To calculate the heat capacity of only the helium, we subtract the heat capacity of the evacuated cell from the heat capacity of the filled cell.
