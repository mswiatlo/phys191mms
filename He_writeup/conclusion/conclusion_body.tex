\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this experiment, we observe several properties of liquid $^4$He and
compute important temperature-dependent functions of this unique
system. The fountain effect is observed as well as the sessation of
bubbling at the $\lambda$ transition. Measurements of second sound
velocity and specific heat are in very good agreement with previous
results; the temperature of the $\lambda$ transition was found to be
$T_{\lambda} = 2.178 \pm 0.081$ K which corresponds to the
experimentally established value of $2.17$ K. In addition, the
superfluid and normal fluid density fractions are derived from our
data and compare well to previously estblashed values. Future
improvements to the system would include an improved pumping system
and further limiting thermal conductivity to the environment, which
would enable more accurate results over a greater range of
temperatures.
